I D ISCUSSION ON THE DETECTED ,REJECTED AND IGNORED OOD OBJECTS DURING INFERENCE The focus of VOS is to mitigate the undesirable cases when an OOD object is detected and classiﬁed as in-distribution with high conﬁdence.\n",
      "* Different from methods that require real outlier data, VOS adaptively synthesizes outliers during training by sampling virtual outliers from the low-likelihood region of the class-conditional distri- butions.

      "* (2)VOS enables adaptive outlier synthesis, which can be ﬂexibly and conveniently used for any ID data without manual data collection or cleaning. In contrast, previous methods us- ing outlier exposure (Hendrycks et al., 2019) require an auxiliary image dataset that is sufﬁciently diverse, which can be arguably prohibitive to obtain. Moreover, one needs to perform careful data cleaning to ensure the auxiliary outlier dataset does not overlap with ID data.\n",
      "* The results are summarized in Table 2, where VOS outperforms alternative synthesis approaches both in the feature space ( |,\\) or the pixel space ( \u0005). Generating outliers in the pixel space ( \u0005) is either unstable (GAN) or harmful for the object detection performance (mixup). Introducing noise (\\), especially using Gaussian noise as outliers is promising.\n",

      "* In a nutshell, VOS consists of three components tackling challenges of outlier synthesis and ef- fective model regularization with synthesized outliers. To synthesize the outliers, we estimate the class-conditional distribution in the feature space , and sample outliers from the low-likelihood re- gion of ID classes (Section 3.1). Key to our method, we show that sampling in the feature space is more tractable than synthesizing images in the high-dimensional pixel space (Lee et al., 2018a). \n",
      "* However, achieving this goal is non-trivial due to the lack of supervision signal of unknowns. This motivates the question: Can we synthesize virtual outliers for effective model regularization?  In this paper, we propose a novel unknown-aware learning framework dubbed VOS (Virtual Outlier Synthesis), which optimizes the dual objectives of both ID task and OOD detection performance. \n",
      "* For both ODIN and Mahalanobis distance Lee et al. (2018b), the noise magnitude is set to 0because the region-based object detector is not end-to-end differentiable given the existence of region cropping and ROIAlign. For GAN (Lee et al., 2018a), we follow the original paper and use a GAN to generate OOD images. The prediction of the OOD images/objects is regularized to be close to a uniform distribution, through a KL diver- gence loss with a weight of 0.1.\n",
      "* Speciﬁcally, VOS sam- ples virtual outliers from the low-likelihood region of the class-conditional distri- bution estimated in the feature space. Alongside, we introduce a novel unknown- aware training objective, which contrastively shapes the uncertainty space be- tween the ID data and synthesized outlier data.\n",
      "* Through our study and releasing our code, we hope to raise stronger research and societal awareness towards the problem of out-of-distribution detection in real-world settings.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Research is supported by Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). We sincerely thank Ziyang (Jack) Cai for helping with inspect the OOD datasets, and members in Li’s lab for valuable discussions. 10\n",
